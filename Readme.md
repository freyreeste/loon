[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rwoldford/loon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rwoldford/loon) [![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/loon)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=loon)

`loon` is a toolkit for interactive data visualization and
exploration. Currently, `loon` is embedded in `R` and `Tcl`.

To get more on either system, go look at the `README` in the corresponding directory above, `R` or `Tcl`.

We also have two documentation websites

* `Tcl` and `R` documentation [here](http://great-northern-diver.github.io/loon/l_help)
* `R` only manual style documentation [here](http://great-northern-diver.github.io/loon/)


`loon` is joint work of [Adrian Waddell](http://adrian.waddell.ch) and
[R.W. Oldford](http://math.uwaterloo.ca/~rwoldfor/).
